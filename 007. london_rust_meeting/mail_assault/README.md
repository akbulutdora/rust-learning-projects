This was a CodeDojo exercise I created in the London Rust meetup in May 2023. It follows the second chapter of the book ["Zero To Production In Rust"](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html?country=the%20UK&discount_code=VAT20&country_code=GB) of Luca Palmieri.

It's a practice on creating an API using `actix-web`, structuring a project and testing.
